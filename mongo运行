Run MongoDB

The MongoDB instance stores its data files in /var/lib/mongodb and its log files in /var/log/mongodb by default, and runs using the mongodb user account. You can specify alternate log and data file directories in /etc/mongodb.conf. See systemLog.path and storage.dbPath for additional information.

If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you must modify the access control rights to the /var/lib/mongodb and /var/log/mongodb directories to give this users access to these directories.

1
Start MongoDB.
Issue the following command to start mongod:

sudo service mongod start
2
Verify that MongoDB has started successfully
Verify that the mongod process has started successfully by checking the contents of the log file at /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log for a line reading

[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port <port>
where <port> is the port configured in /etc/mongod.conf, 27017 by default.

3
Stop MongoDB.
As needed, you can stop the mongod process by issuing the following command:

sudo service mongod stop
4
Restart MongoDB.
Issue the following command to restart mongod:

sudo service mongod restart
5
Begin using MongoDB.
To begin using MongoDB, see Getting Started with MongoDB. Also consider the Production Notes document before deploying MongoDB in a production environment.

Later, to stop MongoDB, press Control+C in the terminal where the mongod instance is running.
