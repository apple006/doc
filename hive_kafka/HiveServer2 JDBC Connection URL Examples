Short Description:

Example URL's for JDBC connections to Hive Server2
Article

There are five ways to connect to HS2 with JDBC

Direct - Binary Transport mode (Non-Secure|Secure)
Direct - HTTP Transport mode (Non-Secure|Secure)
ZooKeeper - Binary Transport mode (Non-Secure|Secure)
ZooKeeper - HTTP Transport mode (Non-Secure|Secure)
via Knox - HTTP Transport mode
Connecting to HS2 via ZooKeeper (3-4) (and knox, if backed by ZooKeeper) provides a level of failover that you can't get directly. When connecting through ZooKeeper, the client is provided server connection information from a list of available servers. This list is managed on the backend and the client isn't aware of them, before the connection. This allows administrators to add additional servers to the list without reconfiguring the clients.

NOTE: HS2 in this configuration is considered a Failover and is not automatic once a connection has been established. JDBC connections are stateful. The data and session information kept on HS2 for a connection is LOST when the server goes down. Jobs currently in progress, will be affected. You will need to "reconnect" to continue. At which time, you will be able to resubmit your job.

Once an HS2 instance goes down, ZooKeeper will not forward connection requests to that server. By reconnecting, after an HS2 failure, you will connect to a working HS2 instance.

URL Syntax

jdbc:hive2://zookeeper_quorum|hs2_host:port/[db][;principal=<hs2_principal>/<hs2_host>|_HOST@<KDC_REALM>][;transportMode=binary|http][;httpPath=<http_path>][;serviceDiscoveryMode=zookeeper;zooKeeperNamespace=<zk_namespace>][;ssl=true|false][;sslKeyStore=<key_store_path>][;keyStorePassword=<key_store_password][;sslTrustStore=<trust_store_path>][;trustStorePassword=<trust_store_password>][;twoWay=true|false]
Assumptions:

HS2 Host(s): m1.hdp.local and m2.hdp.local

HS2 Binary Port: 10010

HS2 HTTP Port: 10011

ZooKeeper Quorom: m1.hdp.local:2181,m2.hdp.local:2181:m3.hdp.local:2181

HttpPath: cliservice

HS2 ZooKeeper Namespace: hiveserver2

User: barney

Password: bedrock

NOTE: <db> is the database in the examples below and is optional. The leading slash '/' is required.

WARNING: When using 'beeline' and specifying the connection url (-u) at the command line, be sure to quote the url.

Non-Secure Environments
Direct - Binary Transport Mode

beeline -n barney -p bedrock -u "jdbc:hive2://m1.hdp.local:10010/<db>"
Direct - HTTP Transport Mode

beeline -n barney -p bedrock -u "jdbc:hive2://m1.hdp.local:10011/<db>;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice"
ZooKeeper - Binary Transport Mode

beeline -n barney -p bedrock -u "jdbc:hive2://m1.hdp.local:2181,m2.hdp.local:2181,m3.hdp.local:2181/<db>"
ZooKeeper - Http Transport Mode

beeline -n barney -p bedrock -u "jdbc:hive2://m1.hdp.local:2181,m2.hdp.local:2181,m3.hdp.local:2181/<db>;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice"
Alternate Connectivity

Thru Knox

jdbc:hive2://<knox_host>:8443/;ssl=true;sslTrustStore=/var/lib/knox/data/security/keystores/gateway.jks;trustStorePassword=<password>?hive.server2.transport.mode=http;hive.server2.thrift.http.path=gateway/<CLUSTER>/hive
Secure Environments

Additional Assumptions

KDC Realm: HDP.LOCAL

HS2 Principal: hive

The 'principal' used in the below examples can use either the fqdn of the HS2 Host in the principal or '_HOST'. '_HOST' is globally replaced based on your Kerberos configuration if you haven't altered the default Kerberos Regex patterns in ...

NOTE: The client is required to 'kinit' before connecting through JDBC. The -n and -p (user / password) aren't necessary. They are handled by the Kerberos Ticket Principal.
